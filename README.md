##OBJECTIVE
* To create a content-based recommendation system for Amazon products.
* Help users navigate through thousands of products quickly.
* Offer personalized suggestions that match user preferences.
* Encourage users to buy more by showing relevant items.
* Keep users interested by suggesting movies, songs, or products they like.
* Reduce the effort needed to find the right product.
* Essential for businesses like Amazon and Netflix to stand out.

## CONTENT BASED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
* Suggests items similar to those a user has previously interacted with by analyzing item features.
* Uses product attributes (e.g., name, description, category).
* Measures similarity between items using algorithms like cosine similarity. 
* No need for user-to-user interaction data (like in collaborative filtering).

## TF-IDF VECTORISER
* Term frequency inverse document frequency.
* A statistical measure to evaluate the importance of a word in document relative to collection of documents.
* It convert textual data into numerical data for use in machine learning models.

## COSINE SIMILARITY
* Cosine Similarity measures the similarity between two vectors by calculating the cosine of the angle between them.
* It focuses on the direction rather than magnitude, making it useful for comparing sparse data.
* A similarity score ranges from 0 (completely dissimilar) to 1 (identical direction).
